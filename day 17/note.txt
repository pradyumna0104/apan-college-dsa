-> four pillars of opps
    1.Encapsulation
    2.inheritance
    3.Abstraction
    4.Polymorphism

    classes & objects
    *****************
-> objects - real world entities
-> classes - group of these entities/blueprint
  
    access modifiers
    ****************
-> private - data and methods accessible inside class
-> public - data and methods accessible to everyone
-> protected - data and methods accessible inside class and to its derived class

    Encapsulation
    *************
-> Encapsulation is wrapping of data & member function(methods) in a single unit.
->  It alsoo implements data hiding.

    constructer
    ***********
-> special method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for initialisation.
.> same name as class
.> Constructor doesn't have a return type
.> Only called once (automatically),at object creation
.> Memory allocation happens when constructor is called

-> "this" is a special pinter in c++ that points to the current object.
-> "this->prop" is same as "*(this).prop"


constructor overloading
***********************
->3 types:
    1.Non-Parameterized constructor
    2.Parameterized constructor
    3.copy constructer
        :-special constructor (default) used to copy properties of one object into another.


Shallow & Deep copy
*******************
-> shalow copy copies references to original array.But array remains same.
-> Deep copy created a brand new copy of the array.

-> compiler generally creates a shallow copy for array.

-> we need to define own copy constructor when deep copy is needed i.e.when class contains pointers to dynamically allocated memory.


destructor
**********


inheritance
***********
-> when properties & member functiona of base/parent/super class are passed on to the derived class
